            The below is very in progress! :]
          </p>

          <p>
            Other mediums don't allow you to easily traverse and connect your ideas.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on where pings live or are recorded, they may appear differently —
          </p>
          
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="assets/images/what-is-a-ping-journal-square.jpg">
            <figcaption>If you record pings with pen & paper, you may only have time to jot down the date. This can still be useful, so use whatever medium(s) best suit you.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="assets/images/what-is-a-ping-notes-app.png">
            <figcaption>
              Relatedly, you can use existing notes apps for pings, simply by using the word “ping.” Later on, after multiple pings have accumulated, searching for the word “ping” allows oneself to look through past pings.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          
          <p>
            We are particularly excited about a bespoke phone <a href="#app" class="app-link">app</a> or related networked technology because it can automatically capture and record contextual metadata, which becomes useful over time.
          </p>
          <figure class="photo">
            <img src="assets/images/what-is-a-ping-app-simple-mondays.png">
            <figcaption>In our app, metadata is our primary bridge. All metadata is tappable and traversable. Each ping becomes a pathway or portal to others related to it.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            This way, your future self can more easily traverse and re-circulate your pings — by day of week, time of day, and weather, for instance ...
          </p>
          
            <div class="ping medium">
              <div class="ping-metadata variation">11:54am &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Monday, September 19, 2022</div>
              <div class="ping-content">peters app should be called “ping”</div>
              <div class="ping-metadata id">Ping 2 of 322 &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; <a href="#" class="author">Laurel Schwulst</a></div>
            </div>

          <p>
            We have faith that there will be some small number of pings that you want to share — either with another person, a group of people, or even more publicly — to refer to over time.
          </p>

          <i>
            I’ve been thinking about what it means to get a “ping from the universe,” and how that's a helpful metaphor for the whisper of intuition. Having that name is really helpful. Because when I get a good idea, I think to myself, “Oh, I know what that is. That's a ping from the universe.” And I can note it down.<br><br>
            Whenever I get a good idea from the universe, I write the word “ping” in my notes app along with the good idea. Later on, after multiple pings have accumulated, I can search for the word "ping” and easily look through my good ideas.<br><br>
