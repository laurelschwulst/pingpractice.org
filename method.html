      <h2>Ping</h2>
      <p>
        Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and
        easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and
        insight. Let's call these "Pings." [ii]
      </p>
      <p>
        A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name, lyric,
        quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important thing about Pings – and what differentiates them from
        other thoughts – is that a Ping is language that moves you, "clicks," or
        otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are likely encountering a Ping if the movement or attraction you
        sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without
        thinking...as if what you are encountering touches something latent
        within you.
      </p>

      <h2>Practice</h2>

      Ping Practice is a 6-step method.

      <ol>
        <li>
          The first step is <b class="step">Sense</b>.<br /><br />
          <i
            >This means being aware and present so that you can notice things
            that "Ping" something within you.</i
          >
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The second step follows quickly after the first:
          <b class="step">Name</b><br /><br />
          <!-- <i
            >Translating – no matter how rough – what Pinged for you and holding
            this ping in the place where you've put all of the other pings
            you've logged before.</i
          ><br /><br /> -->

          <i>
            The most important thing in this moment is making sure the name you
            give to the Ping is specific enough for your future self to recall
            what you were referring to.</i
          ><br /><br />
          To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self can
          find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you first
          noticed it.<br /><br />
          The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of
          needing to know:<br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li><i>What – if anything – might this “Ping” mean?</i></li>
            <br />
            <li><i>How – if at all – you might use this Ping?</i></li>
          </ol>
          <br />
          …the ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The third step is to <b class="step">Revisit</b> previous Pings.
          <br /><br />
          <!-- <i
            >The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important
            thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
          <i
            >How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is
            that:</i
          ><br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              <u>Editing</u> Pings so the language you use to represent them
              better reflects what it was that you initially noticed.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <u>Responding</u> to Pings as a way of exploring all that a
              particular Ping could contain/bring up for you.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <u>Relating</u> Pings to one another to help identify and name
              patterns that could help to explain your resonance with a
              particular Ping or set of Pings.
            </li>
            <br />
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          The fourth step is <b class="step">Create</b>.<br /><br />
          The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you notice
          (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core part of the
          "applying" part is making sure Pings are easy for you to Remember in
          the small windows you have opportunities to apply them.<br /><br />
          This means two things:<br /><br />
          <ol>
            <li>
              Making Pings that are important to you memorable so that you can
              quickly recall them and
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              Organizing these Pings in places where you will you be able to
              easily "reach" for them when you have opportunities to act on them
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          The last step – before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is
          <b class="step">Embody</b>.<br /><br />
          Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them. Doing so
          will cause you to Notice new things which starts the cycle all over
          again.
        </li>
      </ol>
