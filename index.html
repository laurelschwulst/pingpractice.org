            Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some
            invisible place within.
          </div>

          <p>
            Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we
            hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times
            feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”.
            <sup>1234</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            What — if anything — these “Pings” might mean and how we might use
            them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and
            evolves over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their
            significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how
            to work with them) unclear.
          </p>
          <p>Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.</p>

            you synthesize these fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are
            inspired and equipped to embody.

          <h2>Ping</h2>
          <p>
            Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and
            easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and
            insight. Let’s call these “Pings.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name,
            lyric, quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing about Pings — and what differentiates them
            from other thoughts — is that a Ping is language that moves you,
            “clicks,” or otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are likely encountering a Ping if the attraction or resistance
            you sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without
            thinking ... as if what you are encountering touches something
            latent within you.
          </p>

          <h2>Practice</h2>

          Ping Practice is a 5-step method.

          <ol>
            <li>
              The first step is <b class="step">Sense</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >This means being aware and present so that you can notice
                things that “Ping” something within you.</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The second step follows quickly after the first:
              <b class="step">Name</b>. <br /><br />
              To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self
              can find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you
              first noticed it.<br /><br />
              The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of
              needing to know:<br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li><i>What — if anything — this Ping might mean</i></li>
                <br />
                <li><i>How — if at all — you might use this Ping</i></li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              The ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The third step is to <b class="step">Revisit</b> previous Pings.
              <br /><br />
              <!-- <i
            >The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important
            thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
              <i
                >How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is
                that you:</i
              ><br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <u>Afford</u> yourself the space to explore and respond to
                  past Pings in ways that feel true to "where" you are in the
                  present moment.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourth step is <b class="step">Create</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you
                sense (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core
                part of the “applying” part is making sure Pings are easy for
                you to remember in the small windows you have opportunities to
                apply them.</i
              ><br /><br />
              This means two things:<br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <u>Making Pings</u> that are important to you memorable so
                  that you can quickly recall them and
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Placing these Pings</u> where you will be able to easily
                  “reach” for them when you sense opportunities to act on them.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The last step — before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is
              <b class="step">Embody</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them.
                Doing so will cause you to Notice new things which starts the
                cycle all over again.</i
              >
            </li>

          <h2>App for iOS and Android</h2>
          <p>
            While Ping Practice is tool agnostic, a
            <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/experiments"
              >series of experiments</a
            >
            have led us to think an accessible and dedicated app for smartphone
            would be worthwhile —

          <p>
            We are currently developing a smartphone app for iOS and Android.
