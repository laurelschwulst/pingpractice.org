          <div class="large-text">
            Certain ideas sing. They resonate in our bodies, touch some
            invisible place within.
          </div>

          <p>
            Sometimes we encounter these ideas out in the world. Other times, we
            hear them in our minds. Sometimes they are language, other times
            feelings or thoughts. Whatever they are — they’re meaningful energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Ping Practice universe, we call these resonances “Pings”.
            <sup>1234</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            What – if anything – these “Pings” might mean and how we might use
            them is rarely clear in the moment. Their meaning often unfolds and
            evolves over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fleeting nature of these Pings, and the uncertainty of their
            significance, can make deciding if and where to hold them (and how
            to work with them) unclear.
          </p>
          <p>Ping Practice emerged precisely from this place.</p>
          <p>
            Ping Practice is a journaling <a href="method.html">method</a> and
            <a href="app.html">app</a> designed to help you synthesize these
            fleeting bits of resonance into wisdom you are inspired and equipped
            to embody.
          </p>
          <p>
            The method emerged through
            <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/experiments:"
              >years of experimentation</a
            >
            orbiting a central question:
          </p>
          <p>
            <b
              >How might I locate what I learn and experience in ways that equip
              me to apply them in the fleeting moments when I sense
              opportunities to do so?</b
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Ping Practices continues to be shaped by an
            <a href="https://ping-practice.gitbook.io/pings/references"
              >expansive body of pre-existing thought</a
            >
            and through conversations with <a href="people.html">people</a> who
            see making-meaning from what they experience as an act of survival.

          <h2>Ping</h2>
          <p>
            Ping Practice assumes that within the tiny, everyday, and
            easy-to-dismiss moments of resonance are clues to new meaning and
            insight. Let’s call these “Pings.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A ping can take on any form: word, phrase, title, rhyme, name,
            lyric, quote, place, color, texture, melody, idea, feeling, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing about Pings – and what differentiates them
            from other thoughts – is that a Ping is language that moves you,
            “clicks,” or otherwise causes you to feel something in your body.
          </p>
          <p>
            You are likely encountering a Ping if the movement or attraction you
            sense seems intuitive, automatic, reflexive, and happens without
            thinking...as if what you are encountering touches something latent
            within you.
          </p>

          <h2>Practice</h2>

          Ping Practice is a 6-step method.

          <ol>
            <li>
              The first step is <b class="step">Sense</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >This means being aware and present so that you can notice
                things that “Ping” something within you.</i
              >
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The second step follows quickly after the first:
              <b class="step">Name</b><br /><br />
              <!-- <i
            >Translating – no matter how rough – what Pinged for you and holding
            this ping in the place where you've put all of the other pings
            you've logged before.</i
          ><br /><br /> -->

              <i>
                The most important thing in this moment is making sure the name
                you give to the Ping is specific enough for your future self to
                recall what you were referring to.</i
              ><br /><br />
              To name is to externalize the Ping in a way that your future self
              can find its way back to the place in your mind-body where you
              first noticed it.<br /><br />
              The most important thing in this moment is to relieve yourself of
              needing to know:<br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li><i>What – if anything – might this “Ping” mean?</i></li>
                <br />
                <li><i>How – if at all – you might use this Ping?</i></li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              …the ensuing steps will help you arrive at answers to the above.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The third step is to <b class="step">Revisit</b> previous Pings.
              <br /><br />
              <!-- <i
            >The cadence with which you revisit can vary. The most important
            thing is that you engage with your collection. This could mean:</i
          ><br /><br /> -->
              <i
                >How and when you revisit will vary. The most important thing is
                that:</i
              ><br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <u>Editing</u> Pings so the language you use to represent them
                  better reflects what it was that you initially noticed.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Responding</u> to Pings as a way of exploring all that a
                  particular Ping could contain/bring up for you.
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Relating</u> Pings to one another to help identify and name
                  patterns that could help to explain your resonance with a
                  particular Ping or set of Pings.
                </li>
                <br />
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              The fourth step is <b class="step">Create</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >The purpose of Ping Practice is to turn the little things you
                notice (Pings) into insights that you can apply/act on. A core
                part of the “applying” part is making sure Pings are easy for
                you to Remember in the small windows you have opportunities to
                apply them.</i
              ><br /><br />
              This means two things:<br /><br />
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <u>Making Pings</u> that are important to you memorable so
                  that you can quickly recall them and
                </li>
                <br />
                <li>
                  <u>Organizing these Pings</u> in places where you will you be
                  able to easily “reach” for them when you have opportunities to
                  act on them
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              The last step – before the Ping Practice cycle repeats itself — is
              <b class="step">Embody</b>.<br /><br />
              <i
                >Taking the insights you have converged on and acting on them.
                Doing so will cause you to Notice new things which starts the
                cycle all over again.</i
              >

          <h2>App for iOS and Android</h2>
          <p>
            While Ping Practice is tool agnostic, a series of experiments have
            led us ot think a dedicated tool would be worthwhile —
          </p>
          <p>
            We are currently developing a smartphone app for iOS and Android.
